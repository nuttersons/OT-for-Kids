<h1>Testimonials</h1>
<br>
OT for Kids have been a great help in aiding my son Jake with coping with his dyspraxia both at home and in school. They came out to our house and completed the assessment at home. 
<br><br>
The assessment and report proved beneficial in our discussions with Jake's school and we are very pleased with the outcome the report has helped us achieve.

At our school, there are many children who have difficulty forming letters correctly, concentrate or perform well in P.E, which can impact greatly on their learning. With the support and OT Groups available from OT for Kids, these children have made great progress and are now at a level which is not so concerning. As a teacher and SENCO, I thoroughly enjoyed working (and learning) from the Occupational Therapist.

As a case manager, I regularly deal with many private companies. I found OT for Kids to be highly professional, reliable and provide me with flexible appointments that suited both me and my clients. The OT completed a comprehensive assessment and report, which was not only clear, concise and an accurate reflection of the difficulties, but it was returned to me quickly.

As a school we have utilised the service provided by OT for Kids as we have significant numbers of pupils requiring support with Fine motor skills, gross motor skills, concentration and handwriting. We wanted to build our capacity to support them so we have purchased one day a week to work alongside the Occupational Therapist, Nathan. We have found working with Nathan has rejuvenated our practice where staff have worked alongside him. It has given us ideas of activities and resources that we can use outside of the sessions. We have capacity built with a TA who can now lead sessions of her own as she has been able to see the progression of skills developed within programmes. Conversation with Nathan has clarified possible resources to be purchased, which will improve provision for many pupils. The children thoroughly enjoy the sessions and are keen to attend. Class teachers have noticed improvements in the children’s handwriting and attitudes to writing within just 3 weeks.

We have been working with OT for Kids during the spring term. High quality and engaging sessions have been delivered focussing on improving fine motor skills, organisational skills and memory skills. Anticipated outcomes were discussed at a preliminary planning meeting and student progress is closely tracked, monitored and evaluated. This is proving to be an extremely effective provision.

'We asked OT for Kids to work with us as we had found that many of our children were having difficulties with motor skills, which was impacting on their work in the classroom.   We have been impressed and delighted by the progress that the children have made in the short space of one term, both in terms of handwriting and concentration.  At a recent pupil progress presentation, each class teacher independently made reference to the progress made by the children in the OT groups and how much their skills had developed.  We have found both Chelsea and Nathan to be very professional, very knowledgeable, approachable and full of helpful and practical advice that can be implemented in the classroom easily and to great effect.'
