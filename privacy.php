<h1>Privacy</h1>
<br>
The privacy of our visitors to OT for Kids.co.uk is important to us.<br><br>
At OT for Kids.co.uk, we recognize that privacy of your   personal information is important. Here is information on what types of   personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit   OT for Kids.co.uk, and how we safeguard your information.  We never sell your   personal information to third parties.<br><br>
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the   data contained in log files.  The information in the log files include    your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service   provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our   site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our   site and which pages you visited throughout our site.<br><br>
<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
<br>
We do use cookies to store information, such as your   personal preferences when you visit our site.  This could include only   showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some   of our features, such as forums.<br><br>
We also use third party advertisements on OT for Kids.co.uk to   support our site.  Some of these advertisers may use technology such as   cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also   send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense   program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser   you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash   installed.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing   New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing   certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking   ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).<br><br>
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our   cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing   preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.  However, this   can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other   websites.
