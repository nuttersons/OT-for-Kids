<h1>Autistic Spectrum Disorder Report</h1>
<br>
The Autistic Spectrum Disorder report offers an overview of the Autistic Spectrum Disorder assessment completed by the Occupational therapist. You may wish to use the Autistic Spectrum Disorder report as a second opinion, to provide more information for teachers, or as part of a case review or legal issue. The Autistic Spectrum Disorder report will be written by each therapist following an assessment and is a personalised reflection based on how autism is affecting the child. Inside this report would contain important information summarising the following:
<br><br>
<h2>How Autism and Autistic Spectrum Disorder is impacting upon the daily level of independent function for your child</h2><br>
This section would include a detailed breakdown of how the sensory, behavioural and social aspects within the Autistic spectrum are impacting upon life for your child at the very pinnacle of their daily life. For example, why they may scream or shout when placed in a loud, bright and sensory overwhelming room. These behaviours can be confusing for parents. <br>
<br>
By focusing at the beginning and on the basic everyday tasks, our therapists can help you can begin to gain a better understanding of why your child reacts the way they do to certain stimuli and not only this, but use this information and apply it to each new situation to better manage and overcome challenging behaviours that may present. 
<br><br>
<h2>Educational recommendations within school for a child with Autism or within the Autistic Spectrum</h2>
<br>
The Autistic Spectrum Disorder report would also provide any recommendations for your child within the school environment, to further improve their learning. The school recommendations could include providing education for staff on the autistic spectrum and how it relates to the classroom. For example, reducing the sensory input and distractions when trying to relay important information to the child, or providing advice on understanding trigger signals from the child’s behaviour and responding to prevent any outbursts. Recommendations can begin to provide a better learning environment for your child, greatly enhancing their understanding and required foundational knowledge needed for later life.
<br><br>
<h2>Problem identification and Goal setting for a child with Autism or within the Autistic Spectrum</h2><br>
Problem Identification and Goal setting would include a description of the problems identified as being the key obstacles that are influencing your child’s occupational performance. For an autistic child, this will vary greatly depending upon the situation and the individual. The Autistic Spectrum Disorder report would provide a clear overview of where you, the therapist and your child believe their most influential difficulties lie. From this problem list, therapy goals will be outlined in the Autistic Spectrum Disorder report, following discussions made during the assessment phase.
<br><br>
<h2>Future Treatment Plan for a child with Autism or within the Autistic Spectrum</h2><br>
The Autistic Spectrum Disorder report would finally include any future recommendations, including a treatment plan, either on a 1:1 basis or group depending on your personal preference, therapy that you can implement at home in between sessions and any other equipment or adaptation recommendations that would further support your child in receiving a brighter future they deserve.<br>
<br>
