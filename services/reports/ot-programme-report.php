<h1>OT Programme Report</h1>
<br>
An Occupational Therapy Programme report would offer an overview of Occupational therapy programme specifically designed to improve, benefit and enhance your child’s independent function in occupations. The OT programme report will be written by each therapist following an assessment, and is therefore a personalised guide on what Occupational Therapy will involve for your child. The OT programme report would offer information regarding the following:
<br><br>
<h2>The impact of the condition on activities of daily living</h2>
<br>
The OT programme report would define how the symptoms of the condition (such as poor finger manipulation/strength) impact upon daily occupations (such as doing up buttons, dressing), obviously a child who struggles to manipulate objects in hand will find it difficult to do up buttons on school shirts.  The therapist will use their extensive knowledge and observational skills to identify the key difficulties your child is experiencing and match them up to how these functional difficulties are impacting upon tasks other children are completing independently.
<br><br>
<h2>Educational recommendations within school</h2> 
<br>
The therapist would also provide a summary of the impact within the school environment, taking into consideration the previously identified difficulties and how these relate to maintaining concentration/altering focus between tasks, handwriting or participating in physical education lessons.
<br><br>
<h2>Problem identification and goal setting</h2>
<br>
Following an assessment, the therapist would identify the main difficulties to effective participation in occupations and set collaborative goals that aim to improve function. It is typical for a therapist to have several short term goals that address a particular underlying skill that relate to the main long term goal. For example being able to tie shoe laces independently requires good pincer grip, finger manipulation, visual perception skills and sensory feedback. If the child is finding it difficult to tie their laces, the therapist may set out goals aimed at improving some of these underlying skills, the theory being that if these underlying skills can be improved, the child will find it easier to tie their laces.
<br><br>
<h2>Further Recommendations</h2>
<br>
The final section of the OT programme report would provide a summary of the report and provide a clear outline of the further recommendations for treatment, including treatment length, time, frequency and the aims of therapy. By summarising the report, it becomes an easy to read, transferable document for personal or business use.<br><br>
Each of our highly experienced therapists can to tailor the report to your needs, offering you the special personalised treatment to make your life easier. <br><br>
