<h1>OT Assistant for Classroom or Home Support</h1>
<br>
OT for Kids provide ongoing Occupational Therapy assistant support for children with complex needs both in school and at home. This support is provided by a highly experienced Occupational Therapist and implemented by an Occupational Therapy Assistant.
<br><br><br>

<h2>What is an OT Assistant?</h2>
<br>
An OT assistant is an Occupational Therapy assistant. This is an individual who is experienced in providing Occupational Therapy interventions and treatments but is overseen by a qualified and experienced paediatric Occupational Therapist. The qualified Occupational Therapist would first assess the child and outline a detailed plan to improve the addressed difficulties. It is the role of the OT assistant to implement the treatment plan outlined by the qualified Occupational Therapist.
<br><br>
Treatment plans would be regularly reviewed and graded to meet the individual needs of the child by the Occupational Therapist. The Occupational Therapist would also meet with the parents, school and OT assistant in ensuring the best possible level of care is being provided to the child. This would include aspects such as:
<ul class="ticks">
<li><b>Adaptive Equipment</b>
<ul>
<li>Writing boards
</li><li>Pencil grips
</li><li>Seating modifications
</li><li>Wheelchair modifications 
</li></ul>
