<h1>Confidence Improvement Therapy</h1>
<br>
Low confidence can be as a result of many factors; however children who have a condition which impacts upon their performance in occupations are more likely to have a low confidence. Children are very aware of how other classmates are performing, and if they notice that they are not able to complete games, activities or movements as well as their classmates, the child may start to say things like ‘I can’t do it, or its too hard’ far more often, resulting in less participation, less confidence and most importantly a child who doesn’t think they’re capable of the same tasks their classmates are doing. As a parent this can be worrying, you may try encouragement or heaps of praise, however one of the best ways to improve confidence is by enabling the child to complete things independently. Independence builds rapport confidence and self-esteem in children. An occupational therapist has the techniques, games and knowledge of extracting these hidden qualities that we know your child has.
<br><br>
<h2>Why do children need confidence?</h2>
<br>
Confidence is an important aspect of childhood, a more confident child is more likely to partake in activities that are new or seem daunting to them. Poor participation can have a detrimental effect on the learning and development of new skills and tasks. It is therefore vital that children are given the opportunity to grow and develop their confidence and ability in a variety of occupations.
<br><br>
<h2>What can an occupational therapist do to improve confidence?</h2>
<br>
Occupational therapists pride themselves on developing and improving functional skills in people. We are able to provide child centred assessment and treatment across many difficulties. An OT would use a variety of approaches to improve the confidence in your child, for example, by using an activity that increases the child’s awareness of the things they are good at, rather than focussing on things they cant. Increasing confidence through activities can be done through a writing/drawing activity in which the child fills a shield with words and pictures of what they know they can do, and a sword filled with things they would like to do. This activity is very useful as it is on a child friendly level, highlights the things they’re good at and by the use of a sword it uses imagery to almost ‘fight’ the things they can’t do.
<br><br>
<h2>Problems that may require confidence improvement therapy</h2>
<ul class="ticks">
<li>Low confidence</li>
<li>Doesn’t like to try new things</li>
<li>Thinks they are not as good as their peers</li>
<li>Uses the phrases ‘I can’t do it’ and ‘it’s too hard’ often</li>
</ul>
Theory behind confidence improvement therapy is that by highlighting activities they can do, and by providing therapy that works alongside teachers, parents and after school activity clubs, the child can increase this list of things they can do and over time become more and more confident as they become more aware of the growing list and how they compare to their peers.
<br><br>
<h2>Suitable conditions for confidence improvement therapy</h2>
