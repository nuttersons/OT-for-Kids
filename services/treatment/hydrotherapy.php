<h1>Hydrotherapy for Kids </h1>
<br>
Hydrotherapy uses the principles of heat and buoyancy to allow for effective treatment of a number of conditions.
<br><br>
Hydrotherapy is not about swimming, but working your child's body against the gravity of water. Antigravity positioning is great for the development of core stability and muscle strength, particularly the shoulder girdle. 
<br><br>
The water provides your child with an experience that heightens the sensory feedback processes within their body and can help your child be more aware of where there body is in space.
<br><br>
An improvement in these skills can also help to improve your child's handwriting.
<br><br>
Occupational therapists assist a child in the water to facilitate their movements with hands on therapy. This allows a child to improve their balance and coordination, and really work their bodies against the gravity of water. 
<br><br>
OT for Kids offers group and 1:1 hydrotherapy sessions tailored to the needs of your child. 
<br><br>
<h2>Who can benefit from Hydrotherapy?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Children with dyspraxia or developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) </li>
<li>Children with developmental delay</li>
<li>Children with neurological difficulties</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits of Hydrotherapy</h2>
<br>
There are a number of benefits to Occupational Therapy based hydrotherapy including:
<br>
<ul class="ticks">
<li>Heightened sensory feedback</li>
<li>Improved balance</li>
<li>Improved strength and endurance</li>
<li>Improved coordination</li>
<li>Increased self-esteem</li>
<li>Water confidence</li>
<li>Improved handwriting</li>
<li>Fun and stimulating</li>
</ul>
Because of the improvement to shoulder and muscle strength, an improvement in handwriting may be seen - when the large muscles of the shoulder girdle work effectively and are strong, they provide stability for the smaller muscles in the hand and arm to do their job effectively. 
<br><br>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<br>

Water is great for antigravity positioning, an occupational therapist helps to facilitate movement in the water and can be an effective treatment for children who have difficulty with coordinating their movements, their handwriting or may have suspected dyspraxia.
